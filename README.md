# ECE-6250---Advanced-Digital-Signal-Processing-Notes
Lecture notes for ECE 6250 - Advanced DSP @ Georgia Tech

There are already handwritten lecture notes and supplemental notes on Canvas for the course material; I made these to 
1) aid in my understanding of the course material and
2) have a resource for quickly looking up terms and equations via CTRL-F.
    
I would recommend referencing the supplementary notes by J. Romberg, M. Davenport and D. Anderson before consulting these. 

If you have any suggestions or improvements to the notes, please submit an issue through Github or email me at brotker3@gatech.edu
